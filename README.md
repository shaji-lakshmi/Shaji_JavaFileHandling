# File Handling Project
#### by Lakshmi Shaji

This project utilizes the FileReader and FileWriter classes in Java to tackle file handling tasks. The program takes in a text file, in this case a text file containing the lyrics to Dua Lupa's lyrics for her song "New Rules", and carries out various tasks that allow a user to do the following tasks: 

1. Read the contents of the file. 
2. Create a new file and write some contents into the file. 
3. Get some property or aspect of the file using java method. (In this project, the number of lines in the file). 
4. Copy the contents of the original file to another file. 
5. Manipulate the data in the file to overwirte the content and create new "corrected file". 


In this project, the corrected file includes the removal of dialectal variations and chosen contractions and replacing them with words shown below. Finally, the corrected lyrics are sent to a newly created file. 

Corrections to look for based on changes made in the manipulateFile method: 

Original Lyric  | Corrected Lyric
--------------- | ---------------
talkin'| talking 
makin'   | making
hopin'   | hoping
pushin'   | pushing
pullin'  | pulling
ain't   | are not
One   | 1
Two  | 2
Three | 3
'em | them
I've | I have 
Don't | Do not
